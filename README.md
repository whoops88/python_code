Merging lists
You have at your disposal two sorted lists in non-decreasing order of elements, consisting of n and m elements.

Your task is to merge them into one sorted list of size n + m

Input data
The program receives as input two numbers n and m - the number of elements of the first list and the second lists

Then the elements of the first sorted list come from a new line, and from the next line - the second list

Output
Merge two lists into one in non-decreasing order and display the elements of the resulting list

P.S: using built-in sorting is prohibited
